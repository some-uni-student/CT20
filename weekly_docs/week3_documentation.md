# Week 3 Documentation!
(Okii officially it's Week 4 but that's besides the point, I counted starting from zero so here we are)

Finished a clock! I like clocks. All of their little ticky ticky sounds makes me unnaturally happy for no apparent reason. And even without sound I like clocks anyway. It probably has to do with my little obsession with the flow of ᴛime.

3D models isn't my kind of thing, but it was still interesting to learn in class. I've touched Blender a little before (once in my fourth year in primary school, an earlier last year when I was trying to port a model to GMod) but I wouldn't say I have very much experience with it.

## Other Classes
I'm glad ART-80T still isn't delegating any AI-generated stuff as a requirement for assignments. So far it's still extra credit. (Watch I say that and next week's assignments require AI-generated works)

The lecture the speaker gave in CT-1 was very neat. Something worth mentioning in passing.

## Personal Projects
Animating cutscenes is a pain. But I love it when it's finished, because it can look so good.

Until you notice that one tiny detail you missed and you can't unsee it. Then you have to tear down the whole thing and try again.
