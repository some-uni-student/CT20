# Week Technically-8 documentation!

Bullet hells are fun to make >:3

There are still a few kinks to work out (mostly with the dialogue system randomly putting in weird pauses), but it's going along *very* well. At this point, all I have to make are two more player mechanics, then make the rest of the tutorial, and then the rest of the stages of the game!

This will *totally* not take forever! . v '

## Other classes

It's very hush-hush . v '

## Personal projects

No updates on this end this week. Mainly becuse I'm having too much fun working on Projekt Chimera.
