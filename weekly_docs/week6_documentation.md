# Week 6 documentation!

We're well past halfway by now. It's been fun so far, that much is for sure.

The second assignment wasn't too bad either. The only thing that I really got stuck on whas the word wrapping, which caused `\n`s to kill previous lines on me when I set it to word wrapping by character. It was kind of dumb, but I figured it out in the end and came up with a.. kind of jank solution. But a solution is a solution, right?

JSON is JSON. It's data. I've used it in Minecraft datapacks before, using it for crafting recipes and item / block / entity / function tags; it's basically everywhere. Outside of Minecraft though, I don't see JSON as much. Mayhaps it was because of the way it was developed? I dunno.

## Other classes

So we're doing 3D modelling in ART 80T now. I have like, basically no experience with Blender, despite having been introduced to it in my fourth year.. of primary school.

Still though, some of the stuff I've messed with before in Blender is helping me. Especially because I learned how to port certain models from some program to GMod before.

## Personal projects

I am adding *way* too many things to that small modding library of mine. Like, the base game is a platform fighter, a homage fangame to the Super Smash Bros. series. And I'm out here shoving in game mechanics that probably shouldn't fit but are there anyway, like ᴛime manipulation, Super moves, specific universal mechanics from other games, hell, even RPG-like status effects like buffs and debuffs.

Something is seriously wrong with me. I am *definitely* not asking whether I should, instead going straight for whether I could.

That aside I've been thinking about storywriting again, despite how much of my storywriting takes place in a generalized worldbuilding thing I've come up with nearly ten years ago at this point that I'm still adding to / editing to this day.
