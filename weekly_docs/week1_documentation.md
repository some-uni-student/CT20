# Week 1 documentation!

And so here we are again, at the end of the week.

This class just keeps on giving, haha. I like it. Experimenting with P5.js is very fun, and just going off on my own and making things happen is also fun.

I've still yet to do any crazy things, but I look forward to it.

## Other classes

Turns out ART-80T isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Yes, AI-generated """artwork""" and """pieces""" are still allowed, but it's optional (for this week) in the form of extra credit. (You bet I'm not touching the stuffs if I don't have to.)

## Personal Projects

Burnout. *aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa*

I sadly couldn't get much done this week in the way of personal projects because I might've pushed myself a *teensy* bit too hard last week.

I hate this so much . v '

Oh well, I'll get up and keep moving. It's not the first ᴛime I've burned myself out before, anyhow.
