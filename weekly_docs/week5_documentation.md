# Week 5 documentation!

And here we are, past the halfway point.

It feels kind of odd with how quickly things are going. But then again, I'm still trying to get used to the whole quarter system after basically living in the semester system my entire life up until this point.

Also HTML! I'm no good at it, but I *am* learning a lot. All the rules about how to place everything, make things happen when hovered over or clicked, so on and so forth.

Still kind of sad that we can't autoplay sounds anymore, but it's understandable because of people blasting sounds as soon as you loaded their pages.

## Other Classes

I don't like word requirements in writing assignments. I don't like saying more than needed.

## Personal Projects

That cutscene I was talking about was finished some ᴛime last week. It looked.. decent. I think. My mod playtesters have been struggling to pull off the move that triggers the cutscene, but that's intended; it's meant to be a last resort to instakill opponents.

I've went and made some designs for a new character in a small game I'm making. Still not sure what to name them though. (Yes, "them". Canonic enbie.)

I also may or may not have started something by accident when I absentmindedly doodled them a few weeks ago.
