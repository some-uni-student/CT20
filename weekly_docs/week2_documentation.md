# Week 2 documentation!
(Or week three, I guess. I thought the numbering started at zero.)

It is end of week again. Let's see what happened this week...

P5.js is still very fun. I'm trying to figure something out with displaying ᴛime with a tree, and it's.. it's going, honestly. It's working, ish. I have yet to display minutes and seconds, but I've already got hours partially down, and I think it's coming along well.

I'm already throwing classes around. Turns out the concept isn't too difficult to translate from C++ and some of the other langauges I know. I think it's fun.

## Other classes

We're going to have a speaker in CT-1 on the coming Wednesday. I really love the speaker's writing that we went over in the past week, so I'm looking forwards to what she has to say.

As for ART-80T.. well, there's no trace of AI-generated stuff this week, so that's good. I hope to see not so much of it as we move forward because I am *not* a fan.

## Personal projects

My cycles of motivation and burnout are hilarious to me. They happen so quickly that I can find motivation and lose it within the same day. It's hilarious.

Either way, things are also doing well-ish on this end. I tried working on making a Minecraft mod for NeoForge, but I haven't really figured out what's wrong with why item models aren't showing up in-game (along with generally being lost because the documentation for the version I'm using is very outdated). Some of my mods for some obscure Flash game is also going along well, being nearly finished.

That about wraps it up, I guess.
