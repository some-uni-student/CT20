# Week 0 Documentation!

And so, we've just got started. Wahoo!
From first impressions, I'm already pretty excited for this class. Coding is a passion for me \:3
Mix that in with creativity, and an AI-hostile professor? Hell yea.

The projects also look very interesting. I'm especially interested in the Clocks project, and a general idea I have on it for representing the hours of the day is to map it to the seasons with a tree.. though that might be a little overambitious. If not that, then I might have to figure out something else, probably with falling leaves, petals, or something else, I dunno.

## Other classes
My other classes are coming along fine.. though I have a *VERY* big issue with my ART-80T class. The professor said in the syllabus that they expect your own work and only your own work, yet they allow AI-generated work to be submitted? *Hello?????*
Thus far it was only absolutely required in one assignment, but I'm not very happy about that.

## Personal projects
Modding, game development, writing music. Did a bit of all three over the past week, and I'm feeling pretty good about it, even if my personal projects are nothing to write home about \:P
